[Examples]
Example 1: Assign "Religion" to the document
Document: 
The second step for me to morph from animal to human was taking me to the church youth group (which I quickly ceased attending and wish to forget ever happened because all it did was fill me with questions and guilt). The beginning step had been my first communion a few years ago, but I don't think my mother's that committed. My aunt is different though. I think she just wants us to join in her Hallelujahs! and Amens! that can be heard all the way down the street. That ain't happening. We met in the middle and agreed to pray in separate rooms so religions wouldn't collide.

Assignment:
Religion: Describes people's religious practices.

Example 2: Assign "Love" to the document
Document: 
"Good-bye, my love," answered the countess. "Let me have a kiss of your pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that I’ve lost my heart to you."

Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it. She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek to the countess’s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to Vronsky.

Assignment: 
Love: Describes a scene where one person declares and shows affection for another.
